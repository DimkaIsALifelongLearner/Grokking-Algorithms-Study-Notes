## Graph

Generally this is a data structure that capture relationship between objects. It is made of vertices and edges: first define the subject, latter define the relationship.

Graphs are distinguished:

- By weightedness:
  - Weighted graph - edges have weight (e.g. assigned to some value)
  - Unweighted - no weight on edges
- By direction:
  - Directed - vertices are strictly directed (can be bidirectional)
  - Undirected - in fact is a bidirectional graph
