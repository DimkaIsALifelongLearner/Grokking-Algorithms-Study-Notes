	/// The number `5831` is used in testing and resulted in fewer `collisions` and better `avalanching`
	///
	/// - Note: A collision occurs when more than one value to be hashed by a particular hash
	/// function are mapped to the same slot in the table or data structure (hash table).

	/// - Note: A hash function demonstrates the `avalanche` effect if a single flipped bit
	/// in the input causes a change of, on average, half the bits of the output.

		/// For example:
		///
		///		[1]		Int(5)   << 5 + Int(5)   = 5 * 33 - base equation
		///		[2]		00000101 << 5 + 00000101 = 5 * 33 - binary conversion
		///		[3]		10100000      + 00000101 = 5 * 33 - bits shifted (160 in res)
		///		[4]		10100101                 = 5 * 33 - bits added (150 in res)
		///		[5]		165                      = 165

		/// Therefore the bitArray of a number, shifted by 5 to left and summed with itseld before shift
		/// results in operation equal to multiplying this number by 33.
