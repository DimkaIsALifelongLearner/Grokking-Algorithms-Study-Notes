# CH4 â€“ Quicksort

## QuickSore Algorithm Imp

There will be already two base cases:

- the array to sort is empty
- the array to sort contains the sole item

Quick sort algorithm works through the pivot element. Two arrays, one with elements greater than pivot, second with elements lesser than pivot are created from the initial sequence. These arrays are not sorted, they're just extracted from the input.
